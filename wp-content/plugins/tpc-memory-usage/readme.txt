View detailed system information and keep track of your WordPress memory usage, including peak and current usage, and have e-mail notifications sent if memory usage passes the memory usage threshold. Features a dashboard widget, historical data, and settings page for customization.

== Description ==

TPC! Memory Usage allows WordPress administrators to view the current and peak memory usage of the application. This is extremely helpful when testing new plugins, or if there are a lot of modifications, plugins, or large language files. As of version 0.4, administrators now have the ability to view detailed system information about their web server, MySQL, PHP, and WordPress software. (Requires PHP5)

A strategic dashboard widget will provide a snapshot which includes the following information:

* Current memory usage
* Current peak memory usage
* Logging for all-time highest memory usage
* File logging for memory usage at checkpoints, when usage exceeds set threshold, both, or none.
* Ability to add custom checkpoints (checkpoint - a WordPress core, language or plugin action at which memory usage is measured)
* Send e-mail notification if memory usage reaches threshold setting
* Customize permissions to show certain users the memory usage widget and display mechanisms
* View PHP and WordPress memory limit (defined in wp-settings.php)
* View PHP version, User Agent tag, server software information

A detailed system information page allows you to keep a close watch on:

* Server, host, and client information
* PHP information
* MySQL uptime, version, and more
* Common and advanced WordPress settings
* Completes basic security check to help prevent attacks

== Installation ==

1. Download TPC! Memory Usage.
2. Upload all files into `/wp-content/plugins/tpc-memory-usage/`.
3. Activate the plugin using the WordPress plugin administration panel.
4. In the left-hand navigation menu, an item entitled Memory Usage should appear.
5. Customize your TPC! Memory Usage installation by adding checkpoints, and using the on-screen options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I keep getting messages saying my memory limit has been exceeded? =
This is actually a feature of TPC! Memory Usage that you can adjust or turn off at will. TPC! Memory Usage will send notifications if the memory usage of PHP exceeds the preset amount (defaults to 32MB). You can change this under Notifications on the Settings page.

= What is a checkpoint? =
A checkpoint is any WordPress action (also known as a hook) at which memory usage is measured. A list of WordPress actions can be found at <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference" title="Plugin API/Action Reference">http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference</a>. Most plugins also use their own actions, and a checkpoint can be created using those as well.

= Why can't I see the memory usage within the HTML on the pages/posts? =
This can happen for either one of two reasons. First, make sure that this feature has been enabled and you are looking in the correct place. A quick search for 'Memory Usage' (w/o the quotes) may help you find the data; however, if this doesn't work you will have to make sure that the `wp_head()` or `wp_footer()` functions or actions are called within the theme you are using. Some themes do not include out-of-the-box support, so you may have to add the `wp_head()` or `wp_footer()` functions to the theme templates yourself.
